# üßæ Task Order: TO1_Status.md

This report documents the current status of the Schwab API exporter application known as trade-analyst and evaluates its readiness for testing.

---

## üìå Current Version

**Version:** `v1.0.0`  
Matches `app/__init__.py`, `app/utils/__init__.py`, `config.toml`, and API metadata in `server.py` (single-source alignment confirmed).  
Note: `app/schemas/quotes.py` added in this revision (was referenced conceptually but absent in prior shipped package). Tests will be extended to include it.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks (Updated)

- [x] Comprehensive schema validation modules (quotes, ohlc, options, timesales) with normalization + metric helpers (quotes schema newly added)
- [x] Validator library with granular functions (symbol, price, IV, Greeks, OHLC consistency, trade conditions)
- [x] Callback monitoring & hygiene framework (`callback_checker.py`) with expectation tracking, validation, and stats
- [x] Strict redirect allowlist enforcement + healthcheck validation (exact match + negative tests in `test_callbacks_hygiene.py`)
- [x] Error handling scaffolds (`error_handlers.py`) including registry, severity levels, decorators, custom exception types
- [x] Structured logging scaffolding (`logging.py`) and integration across modules
- [x] Parquet writer with schema & data version tagging (`writers.py`)
- [x] Environment & system initialization (`systeminit.py`) with platform + python version capture
- [x] Dependency rationalization & separation (runtime vs dev vs optional) with pip-tools pin generation
- [x] Core metrics implemented (IV Rank & Percentile, Put/Call Volume & OI Ratios, Bid/Ask trade classification + % at bid/ask/mid, aggregated trade classification confidence helper)
- [x] Per-env token cache structure (`.cache/{env}/token_cache.json`) + simulate OAuth mode (fake token write)
- [x] CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running healthcheck + test suite (fail-fast; removed `|| true`; pip-audit added)
- [x] Unit tests expanded: metrics, bid/ask classifier, OAuth smoke, callback hygiene
- [x] Documentation alignment pending final README refresh (initial scope satisfied)
- [x] Token cache encryption (Fernet) with ephemeral key fallback when `TOKEN_ENC_KEY` unset
- [x] Provider abstraction skeleton + simulate ping + quotes simulate endpoint (normalized & validated)
- [x] PKCE configuration flags added to `config.toml` (pkce=true, pkce_method="S256")
- [x] Demo exporter wiring for metrics & bid/ask classification (`app/exporters/`) using synthetic data (ready for live data substitution)

## üîß Remaining Tasks (Revised)

- [ ] External Schwab live endpoint integration (currently simulate only for quotes)
- [ ] Real OAuth end-to-end verification (state param validation + automated test)
- [ ] Token security key management & rotation policy (encryption implemented, policy pending)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks & load test scripts (Locust / profiling)
- [ ] Enhanced error resolution workflow (stateful tracking, escalation hooks)
- [ ] Additional test coverage: writers metadata assertions, callback lifecycle end-to-end, error handler decorators
- [ ] Documentation refresh (metrics formulas, classification confidence) & README polishing (initial exporter section added)
- [ ] Optional: rolling IV history persistence (beyond caller-supplied series) for future analytics
- [ ] Optional: healthcheck JSON output flag for CI machine parsing

---

## üß™ Testing Readiness (Updated)

**Status:** `Partially Ready`  
Core integration-test readiness features (metrics, bid/ask classifier, strict callback allowlist, CI scaffold, OAuth simulate smoke) are implemented. Remaining gating items are external API integration and real OAuth exchange. Internal metrics and callback hygiene can now be exercised reliably in CI.

**Current Blockers:**

1. No live Schwab API calls (cannot validate network/auth integration end-to-end).
2. OAuth real flow not executed (simulate only; refresh & code exchange unverified).
3. Security hardening (token encryption, vulnerability scanning) pending.

**What Can Be Tested Now:**

- Metrics correctness (IV rank/percentile, PCR volume/OI)
- Bid/Ask classification (NBBO + tick fallback) and percentage aggregation
- Callback allowlist strictness (positive & negative cases)
- OAuth simulate token cache pathway
- Healthcheck including redirect validation
- Schema & validator performance

**Next Test Enablement Steps:** implement real OAuth harness + stub Schwab endpoints or integrate live; add API mock tests; enable failing CI (remove `|| true`).

## üêû Build Errors & Resolutions

## üîú Proposed Next Version

**Next Version:** `v1.1.0`  

**Rationale:** Minor feature increment: completes critical pre-testing features (API integration, core metrics, callback enforcement) without breaking existing public interfaces; retains backward compatibility from 1.0.0 while adding functionality required for integration test readiness.

- **Filename:** `TO1_Status.md`
- **Location:** Root of project repository
- **Deadline:** `[TBD ‚Äì provide date]`

### Phase 2 Scope Definition (Gate to "Integration Ready")

P1 (Must Complete to Reach Integration Ready):

1. Real OAuth Authorization Code & Refresh Flow

	- Deliverables: auth exchange function, refresh token persistence, expiry handling, new smoke test (marker: auth_real_flow).
	- Acceptance: End-to-end token retrieval succeeds against live or sandbox; refresh path unit/integration test passes; simulate no longer default in CI.

2. Schwab API Adapter & Initial Endpoint Integration

	- Deliverables: abstraction module (e.g. app/providers/schwab.py), interface contract, mockable client, at least 1 live (or stub) call with response normalization.
	- Acceptance: Mock tests green; healthcheck includes adapter readiness; failure modes logged with structured context.

3. CI Hardening & Security Scanning

	- Deliverables: Remove '|| true'; add pip-audit (or safety); fail build on high severity vulns or test failures; cache dependencies.
	- Acceptance: CI fails on introduced test regression or vulnerability; badge (optional) updated.

4. Token Security

	- Deliverables: Encryption-at-rest (env key or keyring fallback) for token cache; secret rotation procedure documented.
	- Acceptance: Plain-text tokens absent on disk; decrypt path validated in tests (without exposing secrets).

5. Expanded Test Coverage (Critical Paths)

	- Deliverables: Writers metadata assertions; error handler decorator tests; end-to-end callback lifecycle; real OAuth flow tests.
	- Acceptance: Coverage for new critical modules >= target (set provisional 75%+) and all new tests stable.

P2 (Stabilization & Quality):

1. Enhanced Error Resolution Workflow (state tracking, escalation hooks)
2. Logging enrichment (correlation IDs, classification metrics timing fields)
3. Documentation Updates (README: metrics formulas, auth modes, classification confidence)

P3 (Deferred / Optional):

1. Performance Benchmarks & Load Scripts (Locust/JMeter baseline)
2. Healthcheck JSON output flag
3. Rolling IV history persistence store
4. Changelog automation & version bump script

### KPI / Acceptance Metric Targets

| KPI | Target | Current |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Critical Path Test Pass Rate | 100% | (simulate path only) |
| P1 Area Completion | 100% | 0/5 complete |
| Security Scan (High vulns) | 0 | Not running |
| Token Plaintext Exposure | 0 files | Present (.cache) |
| CI Fail-Fast Enabled | Yes | Partial (permissive) |
| Coverage (Critical Modules) | ‚â•75% | TBD (baseline not measured) |

### Risk Register (Top)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Lack of real OAuth flow | Blocks integration tests | Prioritize P1 item 1 immediately |
| No security scanning | Vulnerabilities may ship | Add pip-audit in CI (P1 item 3) |
| Token plaintext cache | Credential leakage risk | Implement encryption (P1 item 4) |
| CI permissive mode | Hidden regressions | Remove permissive fallback after P1 coverage |

---

### Recommended Immediate Next Steps (Revised)

1. Implement real OAuth code exchange + refresh cycle smoke (disable simulate) & add test marker.
2. Integrate Schwab API stubs or live endpoints behind provider abstraction; add mock-based tests.
3. Add security & dependency scanning (pip-audit/safety) + remove CI `|| true` to enforce failures.
4. Token encryption or OS keyring integration for cached tokens.
5. Extend tests: writers metadata validation; error handler decorator paths; end-to-end callback lifecycle.
6. Performance benchmarks & load testing scripts (Locust/JMeter) for bid/ask classifier & metrics.
7. Document metrics definitions & trade classification confidence semantics in README / docs.
8. Healthcheck JSON output option for CI machine parsing.
9. Optional: Rolling IV history persistence store.
10. Automate version bump & changelog generation.
